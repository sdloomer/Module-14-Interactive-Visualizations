# Module-14-Interactive-Visualizations
I created a simple dashboard using data from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset that was provided to us. Using D3, I read in the .json file and with javascript, created a bar and bubble chart that shows the top OTUs and bacteria in each sample. A table depicts the metadata for each subject, which can be selected through a dropdown menu above, and all charts will update when a new sample is selected.

Another thank you to my classmates Taylor Ward and Ethan Musa for helping me out with this as well!
